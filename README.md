Our analysis of the 2022 CDC dataset on key heart disease indicators highlighted several significant findings. Firstly, individuals with angina are notably more likely to experience heart attacks, emphasizing the importance of managing angina as a preventive measure.

 Age also emerged as a major risk factor, with older adults facing a higher likelihood of heart attacks, underscoring the need for targeted preventive strategies in aging populations

. Additionally, racial disparities were observed, with "White only, non-Hispanic" individuals exhibiting a higher risk, suggesting that socioeconomic and healthcare access factors require further study.

 A history of stroke was found to increase the risk of subsequent heart attacks, indicating the need for comprehensive management of stroke survivors. Lastly, while most features showed minimal correlations, a strong relationship between BMI and weight was confirmed, aligning with existing medical knowledge. These insights can guide better public health strategies, early detection efforts, and resource allocation for preventing heart disease.
